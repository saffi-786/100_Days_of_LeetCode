274. H-Index (Medium)

Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for their ith paper, return compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: A scientist has an index h if h of their n papers have at least h citations each, and the other n âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each.

If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

 

Example 1:

Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.

Code :

class Solution {
    public int hIndex(int[] citations) {
        Arrays.sort(citations);
        int l=0,r=citations.length-1,h=0;
        while(l<=r){
            int mid=(l+r)/2;
            if(citations.length-mid<=citations[mid]){
                h=citations.length-mid;
                r=mid-1;
            }
            else{
                l=mid+1;
            }
        }
        return h;
    }
}
