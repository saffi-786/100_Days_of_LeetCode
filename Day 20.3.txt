1759. Count Number of Homogenous Substrings (Mdeium)

Given a string s, return the number of homogenous substrings of s. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

A string is homogenous if all the characters of the string are the same.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abbcccaa"
Output: 13
Explanation: The homogenous substrings are listed as below:
"a"   appears 3 times.
"aa"  appears 1 time.
"b"   appears 2 times.
"bb"  appears 1 time.
"c"   appears 3 times.
"cc"  appears 2 times.
"ccc" appears 1 time.
3 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 13.

Code :

class Solution {
    public int countHomogenous(String s) {
    int cnt = 0, res = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); ++i) {
        if (i > 0 && s.charAt(i - 1) == s.charAt(i))
            ++cnt;
        else
            cnt = 1;
        res = (res + cnt) % 1000000007;
    }
    return res;
}
}
