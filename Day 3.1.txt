944. Delete Columns to Make Sorted (Easy)

You are given an array of n strings strs, all of the same length.

The strings can be arranged such that there is one on each line, making a grid. For example, strs = ["abc", "bce", "cae"] can be arranged as:

abc
bce
cae
You want to delete the columns that are not sorted lexicographically. In the above example (0-indexed), columns 0 ('a', 'b', 'c') and 2 ('c', 'e', 'e') are sorted while column 1 ('b', 'c', 'a') is not, so you would delete column 1.

Return the number of columns that you will delete.

Code :

class Solution {
    public int minDeletionSize(String[] strs) {
        int ans=0;
        for(int i=0;i<strs[0].length();i++){
            int k=strs.length-1;
            while(k>0){
                if(strs[k].charAt(i)<strs[k-1].charAt(i)){
                    ans++;
                    break;
                }
                k--;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
