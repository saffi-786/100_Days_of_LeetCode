1523. Count Odd Numbers in an Interval Range (Easy)

Given two non-negative integers low and high. Return the count of odd numbers between low and high (inclusive).

 

Example 1:

Input: low = 3, high = 7
Output: 3
Explanation: The odd numbers between 3 and 7 are [3,5,7].

Code :

class Solution {
    public int countOdds(int low, int high) {
        if((low&1)!=0 || (high&1)!=0)
        return (high-low)/2 + 1;

        return (high-low)/2;
    }
}
