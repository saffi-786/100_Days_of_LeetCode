2011. Final Value of Variable After Performing Operations (Easy)

There is a programming language with only four operations and one variable X:

++X and X++ increments the value of the variable X by 1.
--X and X-- decrements the value of the variable X by 1.
Initially, the value of X is 0.

Given an array of strings operations containing a list of operations, return the final value of X after performing all the operations.

Code:

class Solution {
    public int finalValueAfterOperations(String[] operations) {
        int x=0;
        for(int i=0;i<operations.length;i++){
            if(operations[i].charAt(0)=='+' || operations[i].charAt(2)=='+')
            x++;
            else
            x--;
        }
        return x;
    }
}
